 <p>Dieting and weight loss are probably two of the most exploited business opportunities in modern society. Fear sells products and not fitting in is a very scary thing. Even though nobody is judging you on your weight, your mind will tell you otherwise and that insecurity is usually enough to get you to drop lots of money on pills, prepackaged food and odd exercise equipment. The fact of the matter is that humans simply weren't built for modern work environments and we rarely get exercise by natural means. Even though everybody is different, the human body reacts in very similar ways when we want to increase or decrease fat and muscle. Although they would have you believe it's a very difficult process, losing weight is scientifically very simple, but disciplinarily, incredibly difficult. Before you even start, make sure that you replace every thought of "losing weight" with "being healthy" because that is simply what is most important.</p>
